## Lego Power Function (PF) Motor speed controller with a 16 LED Neopixel Ring and a Rotary encoder

Earlier I made [this version](https://github.com/rdalen/Lego_PF-Motor-SpeedController) of a Lego speedcontroller based on the well known NE555 timer-IC.  

This design is based on an Arduino ProMini (or clone) and has a DRV8833 Motor driver module, a Rotary encoder and a 16LED Neopixel Ring as forward/reverse speedindicator

For the controller hardware both the Arduino ProMini and the LGT8F328P LQFP32 MiniEVB (Pro Mini Style) can be used or even the LGT8F328P SSOP20 MiniEVB (pseudo Pro Mini Style).

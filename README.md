## Lego Power Function (PF) Motor speed controller with a 16 LED Neopixel Ring and a Rotary encoder

Earlier I made [this version](https://github.com/rdalen/Lego_PF-Motor-SpeedController) of a Lego speedcontroller based on the well known NE555 timer-IC.  
This design is based on an Arduino ProMini (clone) and has a Rotary encoder and a 16LED Neopixel Ring as forward/reverse speedindicator
